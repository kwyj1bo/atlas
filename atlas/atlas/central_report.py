"""Report resource lifecycle events to Central (spec/16-central.md § Event reporting).

Wired via doc_events in hooks.py — no controller edits. A status transition on a
Virtual Machine / Site / Virtual Machine Snapshot / Server, and a VM / Site
after_insert, enqueue a background `deliver` job that POSTs to Central. Sites are
the Central-driven self-serve surface (spec/14-self-serve.md): Central calls
`create_site`, then learns the site reached Running (with its admin handoff) from
the `site.status_changed` event here or by polling `get_site`.

Everything is gated on Central Settings.enabled, so a site without Central
configured pays nothing. Delivery is fire-and-forget: a failure is logged and
never blocks the VM operation (the spec's accepted v1 tradeoff; a durable outbox
is the documented upgrade). enqueue_after_commit ensures a rolled-back
transaction is never *delivered* to Central.

Every emit also writes a Central Event Log row — a MyISAM (non-transactional)
audit trail. Because MyISAM rows are not enrolled in the request transaction,
the row survives a rollback of the business change that triggered it: you can
always see what we *tried* to emit, even for a VM/Site save that was later
reverted. On commit the row is marked `queued` and the deliver job is enqueued;
on rollback it is marked `rolled_back` and never POSTed. The queued row is the
durable outbox: if RQ misses the immediate job, the scheduler can safely replay
only committed events. deliver() POSTs and stamps the same row ok / error /
skipped. The single's `status` field stays the at-a-glance breadcrumb; the log is
the queryable history.
