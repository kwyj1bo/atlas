"""Atlas inbound provisioning API — the surface Central drives during the reversed
registration handshake (spec/21-tunnel.md § "Atlas inbound API").

Central authenticates every call with THIS Atlas's admin token (System Manager).
These three are the only new inbound methods:

- `provision_tunnel` (over the public base_url): bring up the spoke `wg0`
  (tunnel-up.py), lock the public interface with the auto-revert ARMED
  (mgmt-firewall-apply.py), then store the pushed Central service-user creds + tunnel
  parameters in Central Settings. Returns this host's wg public key + listen port so
  the hub can add the peer. Idempotent.
- `confirm_tunnel` (over the tunnel): persist the lockdown + cancel the auto-revert
  (mgmt-firewall-confirm.py) and flip `tunnel_status` Active. Arriving over `wg0` is itself
  the proof of end-to-end reachability that makes the lockdown safe to keep.
- `tunnel_status`: read-back for diagnostics.

Privileged host work runs through `run_local_task` (audited Task rows), exactly like
issue-cert.py; the wg/nft/systemd commands are sudoers-pinned (scripts/sudoers.d/
atlas-tunnel). All three guard on System Manager — the Atlas admin identity Central
holds.
